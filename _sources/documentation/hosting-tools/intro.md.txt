# Tools to Build and Host your Documentation

The most common tool for building documentation in the Python
ecosystem currently is Sphinx. However, some maintainers
are using tools like [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) for documentation. It is
up to you to use the platform that you prefer for your documentation!

In this section, we introduce Sphinx as a common tool to
build documentation. We talk about various syntax options that you can use
when writing Sphinx documentation including mySt and rST.

We also talk about ways to publish your
documentation online and Sphinx tools that might help you optimize
your documentation website.
